# Victoria property market Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of over 800000 rows initially and over 700000 rows after cleaning.
It is scraped manually by myself using Beautiful Soup package from realestate.com.au
website. It has the basic information of every sold property in the life time of the
website. Since the number of sold properties across Australia was too large to scrape
I only scraped the properties in the state of Victoria.
The dataset consists of address, real estate agent and agency, number of bedrooms, bathrooms
and car parks, price, the date it was sold and the suburb where it belongs.
Many rows don't have a price or the number of bedrooms, etc. Therefor for each
analysis as needed I filtered the data.


## Summary of Findings

My goal was to find useful insights from the dataset that can help someone looking
to buy a property.
There are over a dozen different property types in the dataset, most of them not
very common, houses are the majority of property types and my main focus was the
4 major residential property types House, Townhouse, Unit and Apartment.
There is a price gap in the price distribution chart between 700000 and 800000
which is due to government tax cuts.
Some real estate agencies have multiple branches in different suburbs Therefor
they have a large share of the market, major agencies are Ray White and Barry Plant.
Looking at the median price based on the month, we realize that January have the
lowest median price throughout the year.
In general Townhouses have the highest median price between all residential property
types.
I had a look at the suburbs to see which ones are best based on growth. To calculate
and compare growth I calculated the average price increase each year in each suburb and
gave more weight to recent years to neutralize rapid growth 10 years ago compared to last
year and make recent growth more effective. I compared 4 property types to each other and
then compared them based on the property type and plotted to top 4 suburbs for each
property type.
I made a separate dataset of median price for each agency in each suburb for each property
type and in 2, 3 and 4 bedroom categories. Narrowing down the dataset caused the subsets
to be too small and not really practical for analysis.

## Key Insights for Presentation

I started by asking major question that any property investor has, when to buy,
what to buy and where to buy.
I gave a general idea of property types and showcased why I chose the 4
residential property types for analysis.
Then I showcased to abnormality in the price distribution as I see it a significant
finding in the dataset.
Next I started answering the main questions starting with What type of property
has had the best growth. Houses and Townhouses are promising in this category.
The I plotted the bar chart for median and average property prices based on the
month of the year where it was obvious that January is the time to buy.
I plotted the line chart for median price of all 4 property types in the same
chart for the last 10 years to visualize a sensible comparison between the 4
property types and their behavior throughout the years. To better show case the trend
I also categorized the property types into 3 subsets, 2 ,3 and 4 bedroom properties. This
way we'll have a better comparison between them and based on these charts in my opinion
2 and 4 bedroom Townhouses have had a better growth compared to other types and sizes.
As a conclusion based on all the charts, buying a 2 bedroom townhouse in Kew in January
would be a good investment decision.
